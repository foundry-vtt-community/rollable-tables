## FAQ

### Why are there no tables from DnDBeyond?
Most of those tables are property of Wizards of the Coast, however there is a wonderful script that you can use to create your own `.json` rollable table file to import into Foundry. See: [useful_scripts/DnDBeyond_extractor.js](useful_scripts/DnDBeyond_extractor.js)

### Macros
You may want to utilize macros with these rollable tables. Checkout [the foundry community macro repo](https://github.com/foundry-vtt-community/macros)

## Development/Contributing
To clone this repository, along with every table in it, use the following command:

```

You can make pull requests to add or update tables here: [https://github.com/foundry-vtt-community/tables/pulls](https://github.com/foundry-vtt-community/tables/pulls)

1. Navigate to the directory where you wish to add your file
2. Click on add file at the top
3. Name your file with a `.json` ending and paste your content and save (add details in the description field of your `.json` file)
4. Save the file and then open a pull request (GitHub should walk you through these steps)

If you have *multiple files that should be grouped together* and may use a macro, please create a new directory that houses everything and add a README.md file to the directory
